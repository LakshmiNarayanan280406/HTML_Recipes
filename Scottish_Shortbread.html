        <p>Light and very buttery. The recipe does not make a large batch, but it's simple enough to make many batches. The recipe does not double well.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9-inch square baking dish.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Blend flour, sugar, and butter until well combined; dough will be stiff. Press into the prepared dish and prick the top all over with a fork.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until pale golden brown on the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into squares.</p>
